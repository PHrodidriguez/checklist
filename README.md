I developed this app with a very simple structure of components. I started by defining the button with a + symbol, it opens a modal that contains an input. I define the input that starts with UseState 0, then I add a variant to capture the value of this input, I define the add task button that receives the function of inserting the text captured in the input in the initial component "my tasks" field
